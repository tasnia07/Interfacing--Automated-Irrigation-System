# Interfacing--Automated-Irrigation-System
Computer Interfacing Project: A group project

Automated Irrigation System (using motors and soil moisture sensor)using
Proteus and LabView: The objective of this project is to develop a system
that can measure the moisture content of the soil using a moisture sensor
and then pour water into the soil from a tank. Based on the moisture level
water will flow from the tank. The valve/lid of the tank will be controlled using
a motor. You will also need to keep track of the water level of the tank using
a sensor. The moisture level and tank water level needs to be shown in the
labview gui.
